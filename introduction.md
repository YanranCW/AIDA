# Introduction

AIDA is an attempt to bring an open source web-based workflow to image annotation. Currently, in the biomedical imaging space, image annotation is largely confined to single computer shrink-wrapped software with limited interactive capabilities and few, usually closed, data formats.

AIDA is a web interface that enables distributed teams of researchers to directly annotate images with easy to use on screen drawing tools. AIDA supports the creation of well defined annotation trials which include a series of high resolution images or video and a specific set of annotation tasks.

The trial and annotation data can be accessed programatically via a documented [API](api-reference.md).
