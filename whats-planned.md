## Supported Annotation

We intend to implement a few different computer supported annotation tools. 

### **Interactive Counting**

Pathologists spend a lot of time counting objects in images. We intend to support this task with an interactive counting tool. For example, the user marks the locations of approximately 10 cells in an image. AIDA can then take this data as its input and extrapolate out the counting task to the rest of the image, marking the locations of the remaining 100 cells.
