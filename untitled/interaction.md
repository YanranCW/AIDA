# Interaction

The power of a tool is dependent on its usability and good design makes a product usable. In AIDA, we prioritise thoughtful interaction design. The interface should be self-explanatory and understandable, the tools themselves powerful but unobtrusive - leaving enough room for the user to appropriate them to their needs.

We employ a human centred design philosophy throughout development - consulting the perspective of the user in all steps of the design process. We are developing AIDA primarily for pathologists and it is important to close the feedback loop early by evaluating our design decisions with these users.
