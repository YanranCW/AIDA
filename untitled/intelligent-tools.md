Machine learning and pattern recognition play key role image analysis. We will develop human-in-the-loop algorithms to support user annotation with software pattern recognition.

The interplay between human and machine processing is an interesting interface design  challenge. We intend to build a system that requires no prior knowledge of the internal workings of the algorithm and is easy command in a range of different instances.
