# Architecture

AIDA employs a Service Oriented Architecture. 

The system consists of several integrated, distributed, separately-maintained and deployed components. The different parts provide services to each other and communicate through clearly defined web APIs.

Each component:

1. Represents an activity with a specified outcome
2. Is self-contained and updated independently
3. Is a black-box to its consumers
